This repo showcases analysis and modelling based on a project that I completed as part of my MSc. in Data Science. The project goal was to determine the extent to which delays for commercial flight could be predicted using machine learning models.

Central to this work is the On-time Performance dataset maintained by the US Department of Transport (DOT) Bureau of Transport Statistics (https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/). This publicly available dataset provides details of departure and arrival delays (as well as cancellations and diversions) of commercial flights operated by a number of large US airlines. It covers only flights departing and arriving in the US. Each row in the dataset represents a single flight between 2 airports on a given date with an airline and flightnumber that are unique to the date and airport pair.
